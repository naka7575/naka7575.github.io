    Measurement for file sizes

</table>

<p class="bytes"> The term byte is used to measure the size of memory or storage. Typically, storage sizes or file 
    sizes are measured in kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (T B) as shown 
    in Table
</p>
<h2 class="ex3">Magnetic storage media</h2>
<p class="p1">Magnetic storage media depend on the magnetic properties of certain materials (iron and nickel alloys being the 
    most common). Magnetic material is coated on the surface ofa disk or tape that can be magnetised in such a way as 
    to represent a 1 or a 0. Many hard disk drives are made up of more than one disk and these disks are known as 
    platters. Each platter is made from glass, ceramic or aluminium coated in a nickel alloy that can be magnetised. 
    In the case of tape, plastic that is coated in a magnetic material is used to store the data. 
</p>
<h2 class="ex4">Fixed/internal hard disk drive (HDD)</h2>
<p class="p2">Fixed hard disk drives are available on all computers and are the main method used for data storage.</p>
<div>
    <ul class="standard2">
        Uses
        <li>To store the operating system, systems software and working data/files.</li>
        <li>Storing applications software that needs fast retrieval and storage of data.</li>
        <li>Used in real-time systems and in online systems.</li>
        <li>Used in file servers for computer nenvorks. </li>
    </ul>  
</div> 
<div>
    <ul class="standard3">
        Advantages
        <li>They have a very fast data transfer rate and fast access times to data.</li>
        <li>They have very large memory capacities.</li>
    </ul>  
</div> 
<div>
    <ul class="standard4">
        Disadvantages
        <li>Can be easily damaged if the correct shut down procedure is not carried out; this can lead to a head 
            crash which would result in a loss of data. </li>
        <li>They have many moving parts when compared to, for example solid state drives (SSDs).</li>
        <li>Their read/ write operation can be quite noisy compared to SSDs.</li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<img class="hard" src="img/hard.jpg">
<h2 class="ex5">Portable hard disk drives</h2>
<p class="p3">These devices work in much the same way as fixed hard disk drives but are usually connected to the computer 
    via the USB port and can be disconnected and used on different computers.</p>
<div>
    <ul class="standard5">
        Uses
        <li>They can be used as backup systems to prevent loss of data.</li>
        <li>They can be used to transfer data/files/software between computers. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard6">
        Advantages
        <li>The data access time and data transfer rate is very fast. </li>
        <li>They have a large memory capacity. </li>
        <li>They can be used as a method of transferring information between computers. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard7">
        Disadvantages
        <li>They can be easily damaged if dropped or subjected to a strong magnetic field; as with fixed hard disk drives, 
            an incorrect shut-down procedure could also lead to loss ofdata. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<img class="port" src="img/port.png">
<h2 class="ex6">Magnetic tapes</h2>
<p class="p4">Amagnetic tape is a very thin strip of plastic that has been coated in a magnetic layer. They are read and written 
    to by a read/ write head. Data is read from the tape using serial access
</p>
<div>
    <ul class="standard8">
        Uses
        <li>In applications where batch processing is used, for example, clearing bank cheques, utility billing 
            (gas, electricity, water) and producing pay slips; in these applications there is no need for any specific 
            processing order and speed of data access is not essential. 
        </li>
        <li>Used as a backup media since all the data needs to be stored.</li>
        <li>Used in long-term archiving ofdata; magnetic tapes have huge data storage capacities and are known to be very 
            stable, which makes them ideal for long-term storage. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard9">
        Advantages
        <li>They are generally less expensive (per byte) than the equivalent hard disk.</li>
        <li>It is a very robust technology (they don't deteriorate very much over time). </li>
        <li>They have a huge data storage capacity. </li>
        <li>The data transfer rate is actually fast (this should not be confused with data access time, which is very slow 
            for magnetic tapes). They have a huge data storage capacity. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard10">
        Disadvantages
        <li>Very slow data access times</li>
        <li>When updating, another tape is needed to store the final updated version. </li>
        <li>They are affected by magnetic fields; a strong magnet can corrupt data stored on the tape.</li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<img class="mag" src="img/mag.jpg">
<h2 class="ex7">Solid state drives (SSD) </h2>
<p class="p5">Solid state drives (SSD) are rapidly taking over from HDDs. They have no moving parts and all data is retrieved at the same 
    rate no matter where it is stored. They don't rely on magnetic properties; the most common type of solid state storage devices 
    store data by controlling the movement of electrons within NAND* chips. The data is stored as Os and Is in millions of tiny 
    transistors within the chip. This effectively produces a non-volatile rewritable memory. 
</p>
<h2 class="ex7">Memory sticks/pen drives </h2>
<p class="p5">Memory sticks/pen drives can store several gigabytes ofdata and use the solid state technology described above. They are usually 
    connected to a computer through the USB port and power to operate them is drawn from the host computer.</p>
<div>
    <ul class="standard11">
        Uses
        <li>Transporting files between computers or used as a backup store.</li>
        <li>Used as a security device to prevent software piracy (known as a dongle).</li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard12">
        Advantages
        <li>Very compact and portable media.</li>
        <li>Very robust.</li>
        <li>Doesn't need additional software to work on most computers.</li>
        <li>They are not affected by magnetic fields. </li>
    </ul>  
</div>
<div>
    <ul class="standard13">
        Disadvantages
        <li>Can't write-protect the data/files.</li>
        <li>Easy to lose (due to their small physical size). </li>
        <li>The user needs to be very careful when removing a memory stick from a computer incorrect removal (for example, 
            while it is still doing a read/write operation) will corrupt the data on the memory stick, rendering it useless. 
        </li>
    </ul>
