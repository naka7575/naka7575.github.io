<h2>what is backing up of data?</h2>
<p> 
    Backing up refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium (disk, tape, flash drive, etc.) 
    in case of a problem with the main secondary storage device. Backing up files and data on a regular 
    basis is seen as good computing practice and many computer systems can be set to back up files 
    automatically on a regualr basis. An example would be the use of magnetic tapes to back up internet 
    servers on a regualr basis, or cloud storage companies using magnetic tape or hard disk drive to back 
    cilents' data on a regular basis. 
    The backups are often stored in a different place to the main storage. This is in case of fire or some
    other situation that could lead to irretrievable loss of key data/files.
</p>
<h2>Why back up data?</h2>
    <div class="ex1">
        These are some of the reason why we need to back up data:
        <ul class="square">
            <li>To safegauard against loss of data due to the failure of the original secondary storage device; this could be 
                due to hardware failure (e.g. head crash on a hard drive unit), problems caused by files being overwritten 
                accidentally (or otherwise) or possible corruption offiles (for example, caused by power surges).</li>
            <li>To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their intention (they may only want to gain 
                access to the information for other purposes, for example to find personal information such as bank account 
                details). However, the very act of hacking in to files could cause problems such as corruption or data loss.</li>
            <li>Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere; this protects the originals against possible 
                corruption or loss.</li>
            <li>Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect ofa virus. The virus could attach itself to the files, which 
                could mean that the backups are also affected. Ifthe computer was 'cleaned' ofthe virus and then the backup files 
                reloaded, there is a real risk that the virus could infect the computer system again. The best protection is not 
                to get a virus in the first place.</li>
        </ul>
