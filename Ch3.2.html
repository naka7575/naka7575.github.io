<h2>Serial access</h2>
<p class="serial">Serial access is when the files are stored in a sequences and to be able to 
    search through these files you must also search through the files one by one 
    until you find the one you want.

<h2 class="direct">Direct access</h2>
<p class="dac">Direct access is used with magnetic disks, optical media and solid state media. The computer 
    uses the key field to calculate where data should be stored. It is then able to access the 
    data directly from the calculated position. Consequently, access is much faster than with serial 
    access. updating files using direct access, the old records/data are simply written over by the 
    new records/data. It is not necessary to sort records into any specific order first. It is used 
    in applications where data access speed is vital (for example, in real-time operations such as 
    controlling a chemical plant or online systems such as booking air tickets or automatic stock control).
